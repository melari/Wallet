This is the default location of the archive. You can change the location by modifying $__ARCHIVE_LCATION in constants.php.


The format of the archive is as follows:
-No actual files are in the root directory.
-Files are sorted by the first 4 characters of the file name.

For example:
100024.xls should reside in $__ARCHIVE_LOCATION/1000/100024.xls
984523-01Rev02.pdf should reside in $__ARCHIVE_LOCATION/9845/984523-01Rev02.pdf
